## Creating tables with PostgresQL

To create a table, you must run the following command 
```sql
CREATE TABLE   table_name (
    column name + data type + constraints if any
)
```
An example is

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id int,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(7),
    date_of_birth DATE,

)
```
Here is how the created table looks like.

This is a table with no constraints.

To view the table, we run the command `\d` and run the command `\d (table-name) ` to open the table

## Creating Tables with constraints

We use the following command flow to create a table with constraints.

```sql
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
```
