## Operators
They allow us to perform arithmetic operations, comparison, bitwise and logical operators.

Mostly arithmetic and comparison.
### Comparison
Perform comparisons based on certain conditions that we want.

Returns true or false.

SELECT 1 = 1;

//Output will be `t`- true
SELECT 1 = 2;

// f - false
They include:

= - equal to,

> - greater than,

>= - greater than or equal to,

< - less than,

<= - less than or equal to,

<> - not equal.

You can use the operations on strings, dates and any data type.

We can use comparison operators to filter our data in WHERE clause.
